    <p>Cereal. The perfect way to start your day or end a long night when you just don't have the time (or dishes
        washed) to make a nice, hearty meal or snack. Always there when you need that sweet kick, but don't want to
        devour that tub of ice cream or those leftover cookies that went stale. Have it sweet or have the healthy stuff you act like you enjoy, either way cereal has your back until the end.
